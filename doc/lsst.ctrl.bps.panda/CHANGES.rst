lsst-ctrl-bps-panda v24.0.0 (2022-08-29)
========================================

New Features
------------

- This package has been extracted from ``lsst_ctrl_bps`` into a standalone package to make it easier to manage development of the PanDA plugin.
  (`DM-33521 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-33521>`_)
- Introduced a new parameter ``dockerImageLocation`` in the PanDA IDF configuration yaml file to pull lsst release containers from **GAR (Google Artifact Registry)**. This parameter is trailed with ``'/'``, so it could be used in ``sw_image`` path in the following example. And the ``sw_image`` will still refer to the **Docker hub**, if the parameter ``dockerImageLocation`` is empty or not defined, to make the ``sw_image`` backward compatible with previous PanDA IDF configuration yaml files.

  In the user bps submission yaml file, just prepend this parameter to the sw_image path, that is:

  .. code-block:: YAML

     sw_image: "{dockerImageLocation}lsstsqre/centos:7-stack-lsst_distrib-w_2022_05"

  Please note that there is no extra character(s) between ``{dockerImageLocation}`` and ``lsstsqre``.

  In case you have to use images from the Docker hub instead, you just take out the prefix ``{dockerImageLocation}`` in the path, that is:

  .. code-block:: YAML

     sw_image: "lsstsqre/centos:7-stack-lsst_distrib-w_2022_05" (`DM-32992 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-32992>`_)

Other Changes and Additions
---------------------------

- Changed the parameter ``runnerCommand`` in the PanDA IDF example yaml file, to start ``prmon`` to monitor the memory usage of the payload job.
  This executable ``prmon`` is only available in releases after ``w_2022_05``. (`DM-32579 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-32579>`_)
- Make the PanDA example config more easily runnable from data-int RSP (`DM-32695 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-32695>`_)

- Remove ``iddsServer`` from ``bps_idf.yml``, to use the iDDS server defined in the PanDA relay service.
   Remove ``IDDS_CONFIG`` requirements (requiring ``idds`` version 0.10.6 and later). (`DM-34106 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-34106>`_)
- Add missing ``__all__`` statement to make the documentation render properly at https://pipelines.lsst.io. (`DM-34921 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-34921>`_)
